# Instagrid

Instagrid is a Red Academy project that allows you to display the most recent images and social details from Instagram depending on the hashtag keyword searched. This project focuses on using Ajax to draw information from Instagram's API endpoints to load twelve images screen. If the 'load more' button is clicked, twelve new images will append at the end of the previous list of images.
